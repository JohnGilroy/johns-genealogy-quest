        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw (1821–1899) was a dedicated ploughman whose life journey took him from his birthplace in Kincardineshire through several counties before he ultimately settled in Linlithgowshire, residing at Wester Millerhill. Although records do not indicate any unions or children, George's working life is well documented through parish registers, census returns, and other contemporary sources, reflecting the steady labour of a rural life in 19th-century Scotland. He is remembered today as the second great grandfather of John Whitelaw Gilroy.</p><p>Living through the Victorian era, George experienced a period of significant transformation in Britain. This was a time marked by industrial progress and social change, which reshaped the landscape of everyday life for many, including those in agricultural communities like George's. His story offers a glimpse into the lives of those who contributed to the fabric of rural society during this pivotal century.</p>

                <aside class="bio-author-notes">
           <p>George has proven to be an enigmatic ancestor during research.  Born George Blacklaws, he abandoned his wife and seven children in Kincardineshire to flee to Edinburghshire with a younger partner with whom he had five children.  When he moved to Edinburghshire, he dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his name.  When his younger partner died, he married again, bigamously, and had another child.</p>

        <h2>Working life</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw spent most of their working life as a ploughman in agricultural work. These occupations are documented from 1841 to 1899.</p>
<p>He worked mainly on farms in Burnside, Benholm, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Bonhard, Edzell, Forfarshire, Scotland, Cottar House, Mains of Davo, Garvock, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Old Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, Wester Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, North Esk Manse, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland, Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, Midlothian, Scotland, Good Templar Hall, High Street, Musselburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland, 13 Bissell Street Wynd, Pathhead, Dysart, Fife, Scotland, Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Lived mainly in Wester Millerhill</p>
<p>In nineteenth-century Scotland, agricultural work was centred on mixed arable and pastoral farming carried out on estates and tenanted farms. Labourers and farm servants worked long hours in all weathers, often living in tied cottages and being paid partly in cash and partly in kind, with their working year shaped by ploughing, sowing, harvest, and the care of livestock. Over the century, new machinery and changing tenures slowly altered working practices, but day-to-day life remained physically demanding and closely bound to the rhythms of the land.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Early Life in Kincardineshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1821–1839</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw was born on 8 June 1821 at Lambroos, Glenbervie, in Kincardineshire, Scotland. He was the sixth child and sixth son of David Blacklaws, a subtenant, and his wife Elspet Edwards. Shortly after his birth, George was baptised on 24 June 1821 in the parish of Glenbervie. The family lived in a rural community characterised by a mixed economy of traditional agriculture and fishing, alongside emerging textile and weaving industries in nearby towns such as Stonehaven and Laurencekirk.</p><p>During this period, much of Scotland was experiencing the Victorian era’s industrial growth, with expanding railways and increasing urbanisation beginning to influence even rural areas like Kincardineshire. Despite these changes, the social structure remained largely rural and stratified, with tenant farmers like George’s father playing a key role in the local agricultural economy. George’s early years were spent in this environment, where farming and ploughing were central to daily life.</p><p>In 1826, the family welcomed another child, Elizabeth Blacklaws, born at Midtoun of Barras in the nearby parish of Kinneff and Catterline. The Blacklaws family’s life during George’s childhood was thus rooted firmly in the rural traditions of northeast Scotland, even as wider economic and social transformations were beginning to take shape across the country.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Marriage and Family Life in Kincardineshire and Forfarshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1839–1863</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">The marriage of George Blacklaws and Catherine Strachans on May 18th is marked by contradiction. The parish register for Arbuthnott states that they married after proclamation, whereas the register for Bervie lists their wedding date as May 19, after contract.  This is extremely contradictory because the term &quot;proclamation&quot; implies that the marriage was legally and properly consummated in a religious ceremony.  Being contracted indicates that the couple mutually agreed to marry without a religious ceremony.</p><p>George Blacklaw married Catharine Strachan on 18 May 1839 in the parish of Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, after proclamations on the 5th and 12th of May. At the time, George was a bachelor residing in Arbuthnott, while Catharine was a spinster from Bervie. The couple began their family shortly thereafter, with their first son Edward born around 1840 in Bervie. Over the next decade and a half, they had several children, including George (born 1841 at Upper Birnie, Benholm), William (circa 1843, Benholm), Lilias (1845, Haughs of Nether Benholme), James (circa 1848, St Cyrus), David (circa 1850, Edzell), Allan (circa 1851, Edzell), and Elizabeth (1855, Bonhard, Edzell). Sadly, Lilias died before 1851, and the family experienced the loss of George's father, David Blacklaws, who died before 1851.</p><p>Throughout these years, George worked as an agricultural labourer and later as a ploughman, living in rural communities within Kincardineshire and Forfarshire. Census records from 1841 show the family at Burnside, Benholm, while by 1851 they had moved to Bonhard, Edzell, and by 1861 they were residing at Cottar House, Mains of Davos, Garvock. These locations lie within Forfarshire (later renamed Angus), a region on Scotland's east coast characterised by a mix of arable farming and growing industrial centres such as Dundee. This period coincided with the Victorian era, marked by industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation across Scotland, which influenced social and economic life even in rural farming communities.</p><p>George and Catharine's household was typical of the time, balancing farm labour with raising a large family. Their children attended school as compulsory education was introduced in Scotland in 1872, reflecting changing family dynamics. The family’s experience illustrates the life of rural Scottish agricultural workers during a century of significant transformation.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life in Midlothian and Family with Caroline Mathieson</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1863–1876</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">George Blacklaws disappears from official records following the 1861 Census.  There are no surviving censuses or birth or death records that match him, even accounting for recording errors.  The 1871 census entry for his wife indicates that she is a widow, but there is no statutory death record for him. Later, a George Blacklaw appears in Duddingston as the father of an illegitimate child with Caroline Mathieson; the same George fathers four more illegitimate children with Caroline.  The 1871 Census lists George and Caroline as husband and wife, with George&#039;s birthplace as Glenbervie, Kincardine, and age as 46, and Caroline&#039;s birthplace as Fetteresso, Kincardine.  Caroline died in 1876, and on the death certificate, she is listed as single and a housekeeper.  George, who reports her death, makes no claim to be her husband.  When George marries Marion Kerr in 1878, he claims to be a widower and identifies his parents as David Blacklaw and Elspith Blacklaw, née Edwards. Finally, when George dies, his parents are listed as David Blacklaw and Euphemia Blacklaw, née Edwards.  So I have no doubts that George Blacklaws and George Blacklaw are the same individual.</p><p>Following the death of his mother Elspet in 1863 in Kincardineshire, George Blacklaw entered a new chapter of his life in Edinburghshire, now commonly known as Midlothian. This county, which surrounded the city of Edinburgh, was a region of mixed farming and growing industrial activity during the Victorian era, a time when many farm servants and labourers faced challenges such as reduced hiring and lower wages as agricultural work declined. It was here that George formed a second partnership with Caroline Mathieson, a domestic servant, around 1864. Although George had previously married Catherine Strachan and fathered children with her, he left that family behind to live with Caroline in Midlothian, a decision whose circumstances remain unclear.</p><p>George and Caroline had several children together, all born out of wedlock and registered under the surname Blacklaw, a slight change from George's earlier surname spelling. Their first child, Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw, was born in February 1865 at Old Southfield in the Parish of Duddingston. Caroline continued to list her occupation as a domestic servant on the birth registrations of their children, which included William (born 1866), Alexander Straiton (born 1868), Hannah Straiton (born 1871), and John (born 1874). The middle names Straiton and Reid reflect Caroline’s family names, albeit with some variation in spelling. By the time of the 1871 census, the family was residing at West Millerhill, Newton, where George worked as an agricultural labourer. The household included George, Caroline, and their three young children, all born in the Edinburgh area.</p><p>During this period, Scotland was undergoing significant social changes. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 meant that children like George’s offspring would attend local parish schools rather than work at home, marking a shift in family life and childhood experience. Meanwhile, industrial growth and urban expansion were reshaping Midlothian’s social landscape, creating a contrast between rural farm labour and the emerging urban working class. George’s life as a ploughman in this evolving environment reflects the broader transitions affecting rural Scotland in the late nineteenth century.</p><p>Although the birth record states Millerhill it is safe to presume that Hannah was actually born in Wester Millerhill as this is where her parents resided when the 1871 Census was taken on the 2nd April.</p>

    <p class="bio-block-years">1878–1894</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In 1878, at the age of 49, George Blacklaw entered into his third marriage with Marion Kerr, a 28-year-old farm servant from Newton, Midlothian. The ceremony took place at Wester Millerhill in the Parish of Newton, an area within Edinburghshire (later commonly known as Midlothian), which was a region balancing rural farming with growing industrial influences during this period. Notably, this marriage was likely bigamous, as George's first wife, Catharine Strachan, was still alive at the time.</p><p>By 1881, the family resided at Millerhill West, Newton, where George worked as an agricultural labourer. The household included Marion and several of George's children from previous relationships: Catherine, Alexander, Hannah, and John. The birth of their daughter Georgina in 1882 marked the continuation of the family line amidst the changing social landscape of Midlothian, where farm servants like George faced challenges from agricultural contraction and the rise of industrial employment.</p><p>Tragedy touched the family with the death of George's son John in 1884 from measles and pneumonia. Despite such hardships, the family remained rooted in the area, moving to Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh by 1891. George continued working as a farm servant, with Marion contributing as an outdoor labourer. Their children grew and established their own families, with daughters Catherine and Hannah marrying local ploughmen and having children, further entwining the Blacklaw family with the region's agricultural and working-class communities during the late Victorian era.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Final Years in Linlithgowshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1894–1899</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In the final years of his life, George Blacklaw resided in Linlithgowshire, a county in Scotland's Central Lowlands known for its industrial and mining activities during the late nineteenth century. This period was marked by rapid urbanisation and industrial growth across much of Scotland, including the expansion of railways and coal mining, which shaped the lives of working-class families like George's.</p><p>In 1894, George experienced both joy and sorrow. His grandchild, George Blacklaw Whitelaw, was born on 15 March at Springfield Cottage, Carberry, Inveresk, while just days later, his wife Marion Blacklaw (née Kerr) passed away on 28 March at Meadowfield, Duddingston, at the age of 44, succumbing to diabetes mellitus. The following year brought further grief when another grandchild, John Whitelaw, died aged six years and five months at Springfield Cottage, likely due to complications from chronic gastric catarrh and malnutrition.</p><p>Despite these losses, life continued for the family. In 1896, George's son Alexander Straiton Blacklaw married Mary Penman in Pathhead, Dysart, and that same year another grandchild, Alexanderina Davidson Blacklaw, was born in Musselburgh. By 1899, the family had grown with the birth of another grandchild, George Blacklaw, also in Musselburgh.</p><p>George Blacklaw himself died on 12 February 1899 at Duntarvie, Abercorn, aged 72. He was recorded as a widower and ploughman, the son of David and Euphemia Blacklaw. His cause of death was inflammation and softening of the brain, after a week-long illness. His life spanned a transformative era in Scotland, witnessing the shift from rural agricultural work to the industrial age that reshaped communities across the country.</p><p>John Crawford, who reports George&#039;s death, is the husband of George&#039;s daughter Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw.  When the 1901 Census is taken Catherine and her husband John are living at West Pardovan Farm Cottages,  close to Duntarvie. So the assumption is George moved there to be with them.</p>

                <h2>Closing Reflections</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw's life as a ploughman in nineteenth-century Scotland reflects the enduring connection to the land during a time of profound change. While the Victorian era brought industrial growth and urbanisation, many like George maintained traditional rural occupations amidst the shifting social landscape. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 marked a significant transformation in family life, affecting communities across Scotland, including those in agricultural settings.</p><p>Though details of George's family life remain sparse, his lifespan encompassed a period when Scotland was evolving rapidly, with coal mining and expanding railways reshaping the country. George's story serves as a reminder of the rural roots that underpinned Scottish society even as it moved towards modernity.</p>
