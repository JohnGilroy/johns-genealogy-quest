      <section class="bio-intro" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw (1821–1899) was a dedicated ploughman whose life spanned much of the nineteenth century. Born in Kincardineshire, he moved across several counties during his working years before finally settling in Linlithgowshire at Wester Millerhill. Although there are no records of marriages or children, his steady occupation and movements are well documented through parish registers, census returns, and other contemporary sources gathered during the JWG Biography Production project.</p><p>Living through the Victorian era, George experienced a time of significant social and economic transformation in Britain. The agricultural landscape was evolving rapidly, and as a ploughman, he would have been intimately connected to the rhythms and challenges of rural life during this period of profound change.</p>

        <!-- Author's notes (optional) -->
                <aside class="bio-author-notes">
           <p>George has proven to be an enigmatic ancestor during research.  Born George Blacklaws, he abandoned his wife and seven children in Kincardineshire to flee to Edinburghshire with a younger partner with whom he had five children.  When he moved to Edinburghshire, he dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his name.  When his younger partner died, he married again, bigamously, and had another child.</p>

        <h2>Working life</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw spent most of their working life as a ploughman in agricultural work. These occupations are documented from 1841 to 1899.</p>
<p>He worked mainly on farms in Burnside, Benholm, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Bonhard, Edzell, Forfarshire, Scotland, Cottar House, Mains of Davo, Garvock, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Old Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, Wester Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, North Esk Manse, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland, Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, Midlothian, Scotland, Good Templar Hall, High Street, Musselburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland, 13 Bissell Street Wynd, Pathhead, Dysart, Fife, Scotland, Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Lived mainly in Wester Millerhill</p>
<p>In nineteenth-century Scotland, agricultural work was centred on mixed arable and pastoral farming carried out on estates and tenanted farms. Labourers and farm servants worked long hours in all weathers, often living in tied cottages and being paid partly in cash and partly in kind, with their working year shaped by ploughing, sowing, harvest, and the care of livestock. Over the century, new machinery and changing tenures slowly altered working practices, but day-to-day life remained physically demanding and closely bound to the rhythms of the land.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Early Life in Kincardineshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1821–1839</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw was born on 8 June 1821 at Lambroos, Glenbervie, in Kincardineshire, Scotland. He was the sixth child and sixth son of David Blacklaws, a subtenant, and his wife Elspet Edwards. Shortly after his birth, George was baptised on 24 June 1821 in the parish of Glenbervie. The family lived in a rural area characterised by a mixed economy that combined traditional agriculture and fishing with emerging textile and weaving industries in nearby towns such as Stonehaven and Laurencekirk.</p><p>During George's early years, Kincardineshire remained largely rural and socially stratified, with landowning estates and tenant farmers shaping the local landscape. This period coincided with the wider Victorian era in Scotland, marked by industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation, although much of this change was yet to transform the rural communities where George was raised.</p><p>George’s family included several siblings, among them his sister Elizabeth, born in 1826 at Midtoun of Barras in the parish of Kinneff and Catterline. The Blacklaws’ life in this part of northeast Scotland would have been shaped by the rhythms of agricultural work, laying the foundation for George’s later occupation as a ploughman.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Marriage and Family Life in Kincardineshire and Forfarshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1839–1863</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">The marriage of George Blacklaws and Catherine Strachans on May 18th is marked by contradiction. The parish register for Arbuthnott states that they married after proclamation, whereas the register for Bervie lists their wedding date as May 19, after contract.  This is extremely contradictory because the term &quot;proclamation&quot; implies that the marriage was legally and properly consummated in a religious ceremony.  Being contracted indicates that the couple mutually agreed to marry without a religious ceremony.</p><p>George Blacklaw married Catharine Strachan on 18 May 1839 in the parish of Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, after their banns were proclaimed earlier that month. At the time, George was a bachelor residing in Arbuthnott, while Catharine was a spinster from Bervie. The couple began their family soon after, with their first son, Edward, born around 1840 in Bervie. They lived in rural Kincardineshire, an area characterised by farming communities and traditional agricultural livelihoods.</p><p>Over the following years, George and Catharine had several children, including George (born 1841), William (c.1843), Lilias (1845), James (c.1848), David (c.1850), Allan (c.1851), and Elizabeth (1855). The family moved within the region, residing in places such as Benholm, Edzell, and Garvock, reflecting the rural farming life of the time. George worked as an agricultural labourer and later as a ploughman, supporting his growing family. Census records from 1841, 1851, and 1861 show the family living at Burnside, Bonhard, and Cottar House respectively, with the children attending school as compulsory education began to reshape family life during the Victorian era.</p><p>Throughout this period, Forfarshire (later renamed Angus) was experiencing social and economic changes, with Dundee developing into a major industrial centre and rural areas maintaining their agricultural focus. The Blacklaw family’s life was rooted in these farming communities, where George’s role as a ploughman was vital. Meanwhile, wider Victorian Scotland was undergoing industrial growth, expanding railways, and increasing urbanisation, which would gradually influence even rural families like the Blacklaws.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life with Caroline Mathieson in Midlothian</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1863–1876</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">George Blacklaws disappears from official records following the 1861 Census.  There are no surviving censuses or birth or death records that match him, even accounting for recording errors.  The 1871 census entry for his wife indicates that she is a widow, but there is no statutory death record for him. Later, a George Blacklaw appears in Duddingston as the father of an illegitimate child with Caroline Mathieson; the same George fathers four more illegitimate children with Caroline.  The 1871 Census lists George and Caroline as husband and wife, with George&#039;s birthplace as Glenbervie, Kincardine, and age as 46, and Caroline&#039;s birthplace as Fetteresso, Kincardine.  Caroline died in 1876, and on the death certificate, she is listed as single and a housekeeper.  George, who reports her death, makes no claim to be her husband.  When George marries Marion Kerr in 1878, he claims to be a widower and identifies his parents as David Blacklaw and Elspith Blacklaw, née Edwards. Finally, when George dies, his parents are listed as David Blacklaw and Euphemia Blacklaw, née Edwards.  So I have no doubts that George Blacklaws and George Blacklaw are the same individual.</p><p>Following the death of his mother Elspet in 1863 in Kincardineshire, George Blacklaw entered a new phase of life marked by his partnership with Caroline Mathieson. Around 1864, George and Caroline began their relationship and relocated from Kincardineshire to Edinburghshire, more commonly known as Midlothian. This area, surrounding the city of Edinburgh, was undergoing significant economic and social change during the Victorian era, with a mix of rural farming and expanding industrial activity shaping everyday life.</p><p>George, a ploughman by trade, and Caroline, a domestic servant, had several children together, all born in Midlothian between 1865 and 1874. Their first child, Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw, was born at Old Southfield in Duddingston parish in 1865. Notably, at this time George began using the surname Blacklaw, dropping the 's' from Blacklaws. Subsequent children included William, Alexander Straiton (a middle name reflecting Caroline's mother's maiden name, albeit misspelled), Hannah Straiton, and John, all registered as illegitimate births but acknowledged by both parents. The family resided at West Millerhill, Newton, where George continued his work as an agricultural labourer. The 1871 census records the household comprising George, Caroline, and their three young children.</p><p>This period coincided with broader challenges for farm servants and labourers, who often faced reduced hiring opportunities and lower wages as agricultural work contracted. Many rural workers migrated to towns and mining districts, yet George maintained his rural occupation amidst the changing landscape of Midlothian, which was transitioning from its traditional farming roots towards industrial expansion and urban growth. Compulsory schooling introduced in 1872 also began to alter family life, as children like George’s eldest daughter attended school rather than contributing to farm labour.</p><p>Although the birth record states Millerhill it is safe to presume that Hannah was actually born in Wester Millerhill as this is where her parents resided when the 1871 Census was taken on the 2nd April.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Third Marriage and Later Family Life</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1878–1894</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In 1878, at the age of 49, George Blacklaw entered into his third marriage with Marion Kerr, a 28-year-old farm servant from Newton, Midlothian. The ceremony took place on 22 March at Wester Millerhill, Edinburghshire, now commonly known as Midlothian, a county undergoing significant economic and social changes during the Victorian era. George was recorded as a widowed farm servant, son of deceased parents David and Elspith Blacklaw, while Marion was the daughter of a coalminer, Andrew Kerr. Notably, this marriage was almost certainly bigamous, as George's first wife, Catharine Strachan, was still alive at the time.</p><p>By the 1881 census, George and Marion were living at Millerhill West, Newton, with a household that included several children: Catherine, Alexander, Hannah, and John, ranging in age from six to sixteen. George continued his work as an agricultural labourer amidst a period when farm servants often faced reduced hiring and lower wages due to the contraction of agricultural work, prompting many to migrate towards towns and mining districts. In 1882, George and Marion welcomed a daughter, Georgina, born at Wester Millerhill.</p><p>Tragedy touched the family with the death of George's illegitimate son John in 1884, aged nine, from measles and pneumonia. Despite such hardships, the family remained rooted in the rural community, and by the 1891 census they had moved to Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, where George, now 68, was still employed as a farm servant. Marion, aged 41, worked as an outdoor labourer, and their household included adult sons William and Alexander, employed respectively as a furnace stoker and signalman, and their daughter Georgina, still a scholar.</p><p>During this period, George's daughters Catherine and Hannah married local ploughmen, further entwining the family with the agricultural working class of Midlothian. The births of grandchildren such as Caroline Mathieson Crawford and Adam Whitelaw reflected the family's ongoing presence in the region. This phase of George Blacklaw's life was set against the backdrop of a transforming Midlothian, where traditional mixed farming coexisted with expanding coal mining and industrial growth, shaping the lives of rural working families like the Blacklaws throughout the late nineteenth century.</p>

    <p class="bio-block-years">1894–1899</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>During the final years of George Blacklaw's life, he resided in Linlithgowshire, a region in Scotland's Central Lowlands known for its industrial and mining activity. This period was marked by the wider Victorian era’s rapid industrial growth and urbanisation, which shaped many working-class communities. George, a ploughman by occupation, experienced significant family events between 1894 and 1899.</p><p>In March 1894, George’s wife Marion Kerr passed away at Meadowfield, Duddingston, at the age of 44 due to diabetes mellitus. Shortly before her death, their grandchild George Blacklaw Whitelaw was born at Springfield Cottage, Carberry, in the Parish of Inveresk and Musselburgh. The family faced further sorrow in September 1895 when another grandchild, John Whitelaw, died at just six years old from chronic gastric catarrh, likely complicated by malnutrition.</p><p>Despite these losses, life continued with new beginnings. In December 1896, George’s son Alexander Straiton Blacklaw married Mary Penman in Pathhead, Dysart, Fife. Around the same time, grandchildren Alexanderina Davidson Blacklaw and another George Blacklaw were born in Musselburgh, reflecting the family’s ongoing presence in Midlothian. George Blacklaw himself died in February 1899 at the age of 72 at Duntarvie, Abercorn, after a brief illness caused by inflammation and softening of the brain, closing a life lived through a transformative era in Scotland’s history.<p>John Crawford, who reports George&#039;s death, is the husband of George&#039;s daughter Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw.  When the 1901 Census is taken Catherine and her husband John are living at West Pardovan Farm Cottages,  close to Duntarvie. So the assumption is George moved there to be with them.</p>

                <h2>Closing Reflections</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw's life as a ploughman unfolded against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Scotland during the Victorian era. While industrial growth and urbanisation transformed much of the country, his work in agriculture reflected the enduring importance of rural labour amidst these sweeping societal shifts. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 marked a significant change for families like George's, as children moved from contributing to household work towards formal education, signalling evolving family dynamics.</p><p>Though details of his personal family life remain sparse, George's lifetime spanned a period of profound transition, from traditional rural livelihoods to the rise of coal mining and industrial communities. His story offers a glimpse into the experiences of many who lived through Scotland's nineteenth century, balancing the demands of agricultural work with the broader currents of change shaping their world.</p>
