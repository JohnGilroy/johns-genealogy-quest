        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw (1821–1899) was a ploughman whose working life took him across several counties in Scotland before he ultimately settled in Linlithgowshire. Born in Kincardineshire, George’s life is pieced together through parish registers, census records, and other contemporary sources, revealing a steady connection to agricultural labour. He is remembered today as the second great grandfather of John Whitelaw Gilroy.</p><p>George’s lifetime spanned much of the Victorian era, a time of profound change in Scotland. This period saw significant industrial growth, the expansion of railways, and rapid urbanisation. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 transformed family life, as children moved from working at home to attending parish and board schools. Meanwhile, coal mining grew extensively across central Scotland, drawing many rural workers into new pit villages and reshaping the social landscape around George’s home and work.</p>

                <aside class="bio-author-notes">
           <p>George has proven to be an enigmatic ancestor during research.  Born George Blacklaws, he abandoned his wife and seven children in Kincardineshire to flee to Edinburghshire with a younger partner with whom he had five children.  When he moved to Edinburghshire, he dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his name.  When his younger partner died, he married again, bigamously, and had another child.</p>

        <h2>Working life</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw spent most of their working life as a ploughman in agricultural work. These occupations are documented from 1841 to 1899.</p>
<p>He worked mainly on farms in Burnside, Benholm, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Bonhard, Edzell, Forfarshire, Scotland, Cottar House, Mains of Davo, Garvock, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Old Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, Wester Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, North Esk Manse, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland, Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, Midlothian, Scotland, Good Templar Hall, High Street, Musselburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland, 13 Bissell Street Wynd, Pathhead, Dysart, Fife, Scotland, Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Lived mainly in Wester Millerhill</p>
<p>In nineteenth-century Scotland, agricultural work was centred on mixed arable and pastoral farming carried out on estates and tenanted farms. Labourers and farm servants worked long hours in all weathers, often living in tied cottages and being paid partly in cash and partly in kind, with their working year shaped by ploughing, sowing, harvest, and the care of livestock. Over the century, new machinery and changing tenures slowly altered working practices, but day-to-day life remained physically demanding and closely bound to the rhythms of the land.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Early Life in Kincardineshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1821–1839</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw was born on 8 June 1821 at Lambroos, Glenbervie, in Kincardineshire, Scotland. He was the sixth child and sixth son of David Blacklaws, a subtenant, and his wife Elspet Edwards. The family lived in a rural part of northeast Scotland, where traditional agriculture and fishing were the mainstays of local life, alongside emerging textile and weaving industries in nearby towns. George was baptised shortly after his birth, on 24 June 1821, in the parish of Glenbervie.</p><p>During this period, the social fabric of Kincardineshire remained largely rural and stratified, with landowning estates and tenant farmers like George's family forming the backbone of the community. The wider Victorian era was beginning to bring industrial growth and changes to Scotland, with mill towns nearby experiencing noisy machinery and increasing employment of women and children. However, George’s early years were spent in a predominantly agricultural setting, which would shape his future occupation as a ploughman.</p><p>George’s family continued to grow, with his sister Elizabeth born in 1826 at Midtoun of Barras, Kinneff, also in Kincardineshire. The family’s life was rooted in this rural landscape, reflecting the traditional livelihoods that characterised much of Scotland’s northeast coast during the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Marriage and Family Life in Kincardineshire and Forfarshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1839–1863</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">The marriage of George Blacklaws and Catherine Strachans on May 18th is marked by contradiction. The parish register for Arbuthnott states that they married after proclamation, whereas the register for Bervie lists their wedding date as May 19, after contract.  This is extremely contradictory because the term &quot;proclamation&quot; implies that the marriage was legally and properly consummated in a religious ceremony.  Being contracted indicates that the couple mutually agreed to marry without a religious ceremony.</p><p>George Blacklaw married Catharine Strachan on 18 May 1839 in the parish of Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, after proclamation on the 5th and 12th of May. At this time, George was a young agricultural labourer living at Burnside, Benholm, Kincardineshire. The couple began their family soon after, with their first son, Edward, born around 1840 in Bervie, followed by George in 1841 at Upper Birnie, Benholm. Over the next decade and a half, they had several more children, including William, James, David, Allan, Lilias, and Elizabeth, with births recorded across Kincardineshire and neighbouring Forfarshire (later renamed Angus).</p><p>Throughout this period, George worked as a farm servant and later as a ploughman, residing in rural communities such as Bonhard, Edzell, and Cottar House at Mains of Davos in Garvock, Kincardineshire. The family’s movements within these agricultural districts reflected the rural economy’s focus on arable farming and livestock, even as nearby Dundee and other towns in Forfarshire experienced industrial growth, particularly in jute, shipbuilding, and engineering. The 1841 and 1851 censuses show the household growing, with children attending school as compulsory education was introduced in Scotland in 1872, reshaping family life and childhood roles.</p><p>Tragically, not all of George and Catharine’s children survived to adulthood; their daughter Lilias died before 1851, and the family endured other losses during this time. Meanwhile, George’s extended family included brothers who served in the military and married locally, with some members emigrating or passing away abroad. Despite these challenges, George and Catharine’s household remained rooted in the farming communities of eastern Scotland, navigating the social and economic changes of the Victorian era in a region balancing traditional rural life with the pressures of industrialisation and urbanisation.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life with Caroline Mathieson in Midlothian</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1863–1876</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">George Blacklaws disappears from official records following the 1861 Census.  There are no surviving censuses or birth or death records that match him, even accounting for recording errors.  The 1871 census entry for his wife indicates that she is a widow, but there is no statutory death record for him. Later, a George Blacklaw appears in Duddingston as the father of an illegitimate child with Caroline Mathieson; the same George fathers four more illegitimate children with Caroline.  The 1871 Census lists George and Caroline as husband and wife, with George&#039;s birthplace as Glenbervie, Kincardine, and age as 46, and Caroline&#039;s birthplace as Fetteresso, Kincardine.  Caroline died in 1876, and on the death certificate, she is listed as single and a housekeeper.  George, who reports her death, makes no claim to be her husband.  When George marries Marion Kerr in 1878, he claims to be a widower and identifies his parents as David Blacklaw and Elspith Blacklaw, née Edwards. Finally, when George dies, his parents are listed as David Blacklaw and Euphemia Blacklaw, née Edwards.  So I have no doubts that George Blacklaws and George Blacklaw are the same individual.</p><p>Following the death of his mother Elspet in 1863 in Kincardineshire, George Blacklaw entered a new chapter of his life. Around 1864, he formed a second partnership with Caroline Mathieson and relocated from Kincardineshire to Edinburghshire, commonly known as Midlothian. This area, surrounding the city of Edinburgh, was undergoing significant economic and social changes during the Victorian era, with a mix of rural farming and expanding industry. The move marked a departure from his earlier family life with Catherine Strachan, though the reasons remain unknown.</p><p>George and Caroline began their family at Old Southfield in the Parish of Duddingston, Midlothian, where their first child, Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw, was born in February 1865. Notably, at this time George adopted the surname spelling 'Blacklaw,' dropping the 's' from his previous surname. Over the following years, the couple had several more children—William (1866), Alexander Straiton (1868), Hannah Straiton (1871), and John (1874)—all born in Midlothian. Caroline, a domestic servant by occupation, and George, working as a ploughman or farm servant, raised their family in the rural community of Wester Millerhill, Newton, where they were recorded living during the 1871 census.</p><p>This period coincided with broader agricultural challenges in Scotland, as farm servants and labourers faced reduced employment opportunities and lower wages due to agricultural contraction. Meanwhile, compulsory schooling introduced in 1872 began reshaping family life, with children attending local parish schools rather than contributing to household incomes. Despite these changes, George and Caroline maintained their household in Midlothian, balancing rural farm work with raising their growing family amid the evolving social landscape of the region.</p><p>Although the birth record states Millerhill it is safe to presume that Hannah was actually born in Wester Millerhill as this is where her parents resided when the 1871 Census was taken on the 2nd April.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life with Marion Kerr and Family Developments</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1878–1894</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In March 1878, George Blacklaw, then aged 49 and working as a farm servant, married Marion Kerr at Wester Millerhill in Newton, Midlothian. Marion was 28 and also employed as a farm servant. This marriage, solemnised according to the Church of Scotland's forms, was likely bigamous, as George's first wife, Catharine Strachan, was still alive at the time. The couple settled in the rural surroundings of Wester Millerhill, an area within Edinburghshire (commonly called Midlothian), a county experiencing both agricultural tradition and increasing industrial influence during the late Victorian era.</p><p>By the 1881 census, George and Marion were living at Millerhill West with several children, including Catherine, Alexander, Hannah, and John. George continued his work as an agricultural labourer, reflecting the challenges faced by farm servants during a period of agricultural contraction and shifting labour demands. Their family grew with the birth of Georgina in 1882. However, tragedy struck in 1884 when their son John, aged nine, died from measles and pneumonia.</p><p>Throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, George's children began establishing their own families. Notably, his daughter Catherine married John Crawford in 1887, and Hannah married John Whitelaw in 1888, linking the Blacklaw family to the Whitelaws. These marriages and the births of grandchildren such as Caroline Mathieson Crawford and John Whitelaw illustrate the family's ongoing presence in Midlothian and surrounding districts. By 1891, George and Marion were recorded at Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, with their household including adult sons working in various occupations, such as furnace stoker and signalman, reflecting the region's industrial diversification alongside its rural roots.</p><p>During this period, compulsory schooling introduced in 1872 was reshaping family life, with children attending local schools rather than contributing to household income. The Blacklaw family, like many others in Midlothian, adapted to these social changes amid a backdrop of expanding coal mining and urban growth near Edinburgh. George continued his life as a ploughman and farm servant until at least the early 1890s, witnessing the transformations of rural Scotland during the late nineteenth century.</p>

    <p class="bio-block-years">1894–1899</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In the mid-1890s, George Blacklaw was living in Linlithgowshire, a region in Scotland's Central Lowlands known for its industrial and mining activity. During this period, many families in the area depended on multiple wage-earners, with mining villages expanding rapidly and offering new employment opportunities. George, a ploughman by trade, experienced significant family events amidst these changing times.</p><p>In 1894, George's wife Marion passed away at Meadowfield, Duddingston, at the age of 44 due to diabetes mellitus. That same year, their grandchild George Blacklaw Whitelaw was born at Springfield Cottage, Carberry, Inveresk, in Edinburghshire. The following year brought further sorrow when another grandchild, John Whitelaw, died at the age of six years and five months from chronic gastric catarrh, likely complicated by malnutrition.</p><p>Despite these losses, family life continued. In December 1896, George's son Alexander Blacklaw, a railway signalman, married Mary Penman in Pathhead, Dysart, Fife. Around this time, grandchildren Alexanderina Davidson Blacklaw and George Blacklaw were born in Musselburgh, Midlothian, reflecting the family's ongoing presence in the region.</p><p>George Blacklaw himself died in February 1899 at Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, aged 72. His death was attributed to inflammation and softening of the brain after a week-long illness. His life spanned a period of great industrial change in Scotland, and his family’s experiences mirrored the challenges and transitions of working-class life in the late Victorian era.<p>John Crawford, who reports George&#039;s death, is the husband of George&#039;s daughter Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw.  When the 1901 Census is taken Catherine and her husband John are living at West Pardovan Farm Cottages,  close to Duntarvie. So the assumption is George moved there to be with them.</p>

                <h2>Closing Reflections</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw’s life as a ploughman unfolded against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Scotland during the Victorian era. While industrial growth and urbanisation transformed many parts of the country, his work remained rooted in the rural traditions that sustained Scottish communities for generations. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 would have marked a significant shift in family life during his later years, reflecting broader social changes even in agricultural areas.</p><p>Though details of his personal and family life are sparse, George’s experience embodies the quiet resilience of those who maintained the agricultural foundations of Scotland amidst sweeping economic and social transformations. His lifetime bridged the old rural ways and the new industrial age, offering a glimpse into the lives of the many who contributed to Scotland’s history beyond the cities and coalfields.</p>
