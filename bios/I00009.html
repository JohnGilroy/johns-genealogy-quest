      <section class="bio-intro" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw (1821–1899) was an agricultural labourer who spent his life primarily in Kincardineshire, Scotland, with periods living in other counties before eventually settling in Linlithgowshire. Over the course of his life, George entered into three unions and fathered at least fourteen children. His working life, as indicated by surviving parish registers, census records, and other contemporary sources, was largely devoted to agricultural labour.</p><p>George’s lifetime spanned much of the Victorian era, a time of significant transformation across Scotland. This period saw rapid industrial growth, the expansion of railways, and increasing urbanisation. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 altered family dynamics, as children began attending parish and board schools rather than working to support their households. Meanwhile, coal mining grew extensively in central Scotland, attracting many rural workers to emerging pit villages and reshaping the social and economic landscape of the country.</p><p class="bio-author-notes">George has proven to be an enigmatic ancestor during research.  Born George Blacklaws, he abandoned his wife and seven children in Kincardineshire to flee to Edinburghshire with a younger partner with whom he had five children.  When he moved to Edinburghshire, he dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his name.  When his younger partner died, he married again, bigamously, and had another child.  The details of George&#039;s second marriage provide conclusive evidence that the Kincardineshire and Edinburghshire George Blacklaws are the same person.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Early Life and Family Beginnings</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1821–1839</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw was born on 8 June 1821 at Lambroos in Glenbervie, Kincardineshire, Scotland. He was the son of David Blacklaws, a subtenant, and his wife Elspet Edwards. Shortly after his birth, George was baptised on 24 June 1821 in the parish of Glenbervie, marking his formal introduction into the local community. The family lived in a rural setting typical of the region during this period.</p><p>In 1826, George's sister Elizabeth was born on 6 March in the parish of Kinneff and Catterline. She was baptised there on 9 June 1826, with the same parents, David and Elspet. This reflects the family's connections within the neighbouring parishes of Kincardineshire, a largely agricultural area where many families lived and worked on the land.</p><p>By 1839, George had reached adulthood and married Catharine Strachan in the parish of Arbuthnott on 18 May. Their marriage followed proclamations on the 5th and 12th of May, a customary practice to announce the union publicly. At the time of their marriage, George was described as a bachelor residing in Arbuthnott, while Catharine was a spinster from Bervie. This union marked the beginning of George’s adult life and family formation within the rural communities of Kincardineshire.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Marriage and Family Life with Catherine Strachan</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1839–1863</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw married Catharine Strachan on 18 May 1839 in the parish of Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, after their banns were proclaimed earlier that month. At the time of their marriage, George was a bachelor residing in Arbuthnott, while Catharine was a spinster from Bervie. Following their union, George continued his work as an agricultural labourer, a common occupation in rural Scotland during the Victorian era.</p><p>Over the next two decades, George and Catharine built a large family, with at least eight children born between approximately 1840 and 1855. Their first son, Edward, was born around 1840 in Bervie, followed by George in 1841, William around 1843, Lilias in 1845, James about 1848, David circa 1850, Allan around 1851, and Elizabeth in 1855. The family moved within the Kincardineshire and Forfarshire areas, residing at places such as Burnside in Benholm, Bonhard in Edzell, and later at Cottar House, Mains of Davos in Garvock. Throughout this period, George's occupation evolved from agricultural labourer to ploughman, reflecting his continued engagement in farming work.</p><p>The 1841 and 1851 censuses provide a glimpse into their household life, showing George and Catharine living with their young children, some of whom were attending school by 1851. Their household was typical of rural Scottish families of the time, balancing agricultural work with raising children in a period marked by social and economic change, including the introduction of compulsory schooling in Scotland in 1872.</p><p>During these years, George also experienced the loss of family members, including the death of his father David Blacklaws before 1851 and the passing of his mother Elspet Edward in 1863. Despite these personal challenges, George and Catharine's marriage and family life spanned over two decades, laying the foundation for subsequent generations of the Blacklaw family.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life with Caroline Mathieson and Family Growth</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1863–1876</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>Following the death of his mother Elspet in early 1863, George Blacklaw entered into a second partnership with Caroline Mathieson around 1864. This marked a significant transition in his life as he moved from Kincardineshire to Edinburghshire, leaving behind his previous family with Catherine Strachan. Caroline, a domestic servant by occupation, and George began their life together at Old Southfield in the Parish of Duddingston, where their first child, Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw, was born in February 1865. At this time, George also began using the surname Blacklaw, dropping the 's' from his original surname.</p><p>Over the next decade, George and Caroline expanded their family with the births of William in 1866, Alexander Straiton in 1868, Hannah Straiton in 1871, and John in 1874. The children's middle names often reflected Caroline's maternal family name, though occasionally misspelled. Throughout this period, George continued his work as an agricultural labourer and ploughman, residing with his family at West Millerhill in Newton, Midlothian by the 1871 census.</p><p>Despite the challenges of rural life during the Victorian era, including the social changes brought by compulsory schooling and industrial growth in Scotland, George and Caroline maintained their household. Tragically, Caroline died at the young age of 30 in March 1876 at Millerhill, Newton, from septicaemia, leaving George to care for their young children. This period of George's life reflects both the joys and hardships of a farming family in nineteenth-century Scotland.

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Third Marriage and Later Family Life</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1878–1894</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In March 1878, at the age of 49, George Blacklaw entered into his third marriage, wedding Marion Kerr at Wester Millerhill in Newton, Midlothian. George was described as a widowed farm servant, son of the late David and Elspith Blacklaw, while Marion was a 28-year-old farm servant and daughter of Andrew Kerr, a coalminer, and the late Janet Kerr. Notably, this marriage was almost certainly bigamous, as George's first wife, Catharine Strachan, was still alive at the time.</p><p>By the 1881 census, George was working as an agricultural labourer and living at Millerhill West with Marion and several of his children from previous relationships, including his daughter Catherine, an outworker, and younger children attending school. The family grew with the birth of Georgina Blacklaw in February 1882, born to George and Marion at Wester Millerhill.</p><p>Tragedy touched the family during this period as well. George's illegitimate son John, aged nine, died in 1884 from measles and pneumonia. Despite such hardships, the family continued to develop. George's daughter Catherine married John Crawford, a ploughman, in 1887, and their children, including Caroline Mathieson Crawford, were born in the following years. Similarly, his daughter Hannah married John Whitelaw in 1888, and they had several children, including John and George Blacklaw Whitelaw.</p><p>By 1891, George, now 68, was recorded as a farm servant residing at Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, with Marion and some of their children, who had begun working in various occupations such as furnace stoking and signalling. Sadly, Marion passed away in March 1894 at Meadowfield, Duddingston, aged 44, due to diabetes mellitus. At that time, George was noted as a labourer, marking the close of this chapter of his family life.

    <p class="bio-block-years">1894–1899</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In the final years of his life, George Blacklaw experienced significant family events marked by both joy and sorrow. In March 1894, his daughter Hannah Whitelaw, née Blacklaw, gave birth to a son, George Blacklaw Whitelaw, at Springfield Cottage in Carberry, Inveresk. However, this period was also shadowed by the death of George's wife, Marion Kerr, who passed away on 28 March 1894 at Meadowfield, Duddingston, at the age of 44, due to diabetes mellitus. George was recorded as a labourer at this time, continuing his work as an agricultural labourer in the Edinburghshire area.</p><p>The following years saw further family tragedies. In September 1895, George's grandson John Whitelaw died at just six years old at Springfield Cottage, Carberry. The cause of death was chronic gastric catarrh, though malnutrition likely contributed due to difficulties digesting food. Despite these hardships, life continued with new beginnings; in December 1896, George's son Alexander Blacklaw married Mary Penman in Pathhead, Fife. Around this time, grandchildren Alexanderina Davidson Blacklaw and George Blacklaw were born in Musselburgh, Midlothian, in 1896 and 1899 respectively.</p><p>George Blacklaw himself passed away on 12 February 1899 at Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, aged 72. At the time of his death, he was a widower and was described as a ploughman, reflecting his lifelong connection to agricultural labour. The cause of death was inflammation and softening of the brain, and he was survived by a large family that had endured both growth and loss during these later years.</p>

                <h2></h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw's life as an agricultural labourer unfolded against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Scotland during the Victorian era. While industrial growth and urbanisation transformed many parts of the country, George remained connected to the rural traditions that sustained much of the population. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 would have marked a significant shift in family dynamics and community life during his later years, reflecting broader societal changes even in agricultural settings.</p><p>Though details of his family life are scarce, George's story embodies the experiences of many rural workers who witnessed the profound economic and social transformations of nineteenth-century Scotland. His lifetime spanned a period when the rhythms of rural labour coexisted with the expanding influence of industry and education, illustrating the complex interplay between tradition and progress in this pivotal era.</p>
