      <section class="bio-intro" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw (1821–1899) was a dedicated ploughman whose life journey took him from his birthplace in Kincardineshire to various counties before he ultimately settled in Linlithgowshire. Throughout his working years, George maintained a steady occupation in agriculture, reflecting the rural livelihoods of the time. Although there are no records of marriage or children, his legacy endures as the second great grandfather of John Whitelaw Gilroy.</p><p>Living through the Victorian era, George experienced a period of significant transformation in British society. This was a time marked by industrial progress and social change, which reshaped the daily lives of many, including those in rural communities like George's. His story, pieced together from parish registers, census data, and other historical documents, offers a window into the life of a 19th-century agricultural worker navigating these evolving times.</p>

                <aside class="bio-author-notes">
           <p>George has proven to be an enigmatic ancestor during research.  Born George Blacklaws, he abandoned his wife and seven children in Kincardineshire to flee to Edinburghshire with a younger partner with whom he had five children.  When he moved to Edinburghshire, he dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his name.  When his younger partner died, he married again, bigamously, and had another child.</p>

        <h2>Working life</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw spent most of their working life as a ploughman in agricultural work. These occupations are documented from 1841 to 1899.</p>
<p>He worked mainly on farms in Burnside, Benholm, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Bonhard, Edzell, Forfarshire, Scotland, Cottar House, Mains of Davo, Garvock, Kincardineshire, Scotland, Old Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Southfield, Duddingston, Midlothian, Scotland, Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, Wester Millerhill, Newton, Midlothian, Scotland, North Esk Manse, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland, Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, Midlothian, Scotland, Good Templar Hall, High Street, Musselburgh, Edinburghshire, Scotland, 13 Bissell Street Wynd, Pathhead, Dysart, Fife, Scotland, Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Lived mainly in Wester Millerhill</p>
<p>In nineteenth-century Scotland, agricultural work was centred on mixed arable and pastoral farming carried out on estates and tenanted farms. Labourers and farm servants worked long hours in all weathers, often living in tied cottages and being paid partly in cash and partly in kind, with their working year shaped by ploughing, sowing, harvest, and the care of livestock. Over the century, new machinery and changing tenures slowly altered working practices, but day-to-day life remained physically demanding and closely bound to the rhythms of the land.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Early Life in Kincardineshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1821–1839</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw was born on 8 June 1821 at Lambroos, Glenbervie, in Kincardineshire, Scotland. He was the sixth child and sixth son of David Blacklaws, a subtenant, and his wife Elspet Edwards. The family lived in a rural area along the northeast coast south of Aberdeen, where agriculture remained the mainstay of local life amidst the beginnings of industrial change. George was baptised shortly after his birth on 24 June 1821 in the parish of Glenbervie.</p><p>During George's childhood, Kincardineshire combined traditional farming and fishing with emerging textile and weaving industries in nearby towns such as Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. The social structure was largely rural and stratified, with tenant farmers like his father working the land under landowning estates. This period coincided with the wider Victorian era in Scotland, marked by industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation, although such changes would only gradually affect rural communities like George's.</p><p>George’s family continued to grow, with his sister Elizabeth born in 1826 at Midtoun of Barras in the parish of Kinneff and Catterline, also within Kincardineshire. Throughout his early years, George would have been shaped by the rhythms of rural life and the beginning shifts in local employment patterns, setting the foundation for his later work as a ploughman.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Marriage and Family Life in Kincardineshire and Forfarshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1839–1863</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">The marriage of George Blacklaws and Catherine Strachans on May 18th is marked by contradiction. The parish register for Arbuthnott states that they married after proclamation, whereas the register for Bervie lists their wedding date as May 19, after contract.  This is extremely contradictory because the term &quot;proclamation&quot; implies that the marriage was legally and properly consummated in a religious ceremony.  Being contracted indicates that the couple mutually agreed to marry without a religious ceremony.</p><p>In May 1839, George Blacklaw married Catharine Strachan in the parish of Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, after proclamations on the 5th and 12th of May. Settling initially in the rural communities of Kincardineshire, George worked as an agricultural labourer and later as a ploughman, a common occupation in the farming districts along Scotland's east coast. Over the next sixteen years, George and Catharine raised a large family, with their children born across several parishes including Benholm, St Cyrus, Edzell, and Garvock, reflecting the family's movement within the region.</p><p>Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, their household grew steadily. Their first child, Edward, was born around 1840 in Bervie, followed by several siblings: George, William, James, David, Allan, Lilias, and Elizabeth. Sadly, not all survived childhood; Lilias died before 1851, and the family experienced the loss of other relatives during this period. The 1851 and 1861 censuses record George as an agricultural labourer and later a ploughman residing at Bonhard, Edzell, and then at Cottar House, Mains of Davos, Garvock, indicating continued residence within Forfarshire (later renamed Angus). His wife Catherine remained a homemaker, supporting the family in these rural communities.</p><p>This period in George's life unfolded during the Victorian era, a time of significant industrial growth and social change across Scotland. While Dundee and other urban centres in Forfarshire expanded rapidly with industries such as jute manufacturing and shipbuilding, rural areas like those where George lived remained focused on traditional farming. Compulsory schooling introduced in 1872 was yet to affect this generation, but the gradual urbanisation and improved transport networks of the time would begin to reshape family and community life in the decades following.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life with Caroline Mathieson in Midlothian</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1863–1876</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p class="bio-author-notes">George Blacklaws disappears from official records following the 1861 Census.  There are no surviving censuses or birth or death records that match him, even accounting for recording errors.  The 1871 census entry for his wife indicates that she is a widow, but there is no statutory death record for him. Later, a George Blacklaw appears in Duddingston as the father of an illegitimate child with Caroline Mathieson; the same George fathers four more illegitimate children with Caroline.  The 1871 Census lists George and Caroline as husband and wife, with George&#039;s birthplace as Glenbervie, Kincardine, and age as 46, and Caroline&#039;s birthplace as Fetteresso, Kincardine.  Caroline died in 1876, and on the death certificate, she is listed as single and a housekeeper.  George, who reports her death, makes no claim to be her husband.  When George marries Marion Kerr in 1878, he claims to be a widower and identifies his parents as David Blacklaw and Elspith Blacklaw, née Edwards. Finally, when George dies, his parents are listed as David Blacklaw and Euphemia Blacklaw, née Edwards.  So I have no doubts that George Blacklaws and George Blacklaw are the same individual.</p><p>Following the death of his mother Elspet in early 1863, George Blacklaw entered a new chapter of his life in Edinburghshire, commonly known as Midlothian. This county, encircling the city of Edinburgh, was a region of mixed farming alongside burgeoning heavy industry and coal mining, reflecting the economic diversity of Victorian Scotland. Amidst these changing times, farm servants like George often faced challenges such as reduced hiring and lower wages, prompting many to adapt their livelihoods accordingly.</p><p>By 1864, George had formed a second partnership with Caroline Mathieson, a domestic servant from Kincardineshire. They relocated to the parish of Duddingston near Edinburgh, where their first child, Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw, was born in 1865. Notably, at this time George began using the surname 'Blacklaw' without the 's'. Over the following years, the couple had several more children, including William (1866), Alexander Straiton (1868), Hannah Straiton (1871), and John (1874). Caroline continued to list her occupation as domestic servant on birth registrations, while George worked as a ploughman and farm servant, reflecting their working-class rural lifestyle within a county increasingly influenced by urban expansion.</p><p>By the 1871 census, the family was residing at West Millerhill in the parish of Newton, Midlothian. George, aged 46, was recorded as an agricultural labourer living with Caroline and their three young children. This period coincided with significant social changes, including the introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872, which would have affected the upbringing of their children as education became more accessible and mandatory. Despite the pressures of the time, George and Caroline maintained their household in a region balancing traditional farming with the encroaching industrial age.</p><p>Although the birth record states Millerhill it is safe to presume that Hannah was actually born in Wester Millerhill as this is where her parents resided when the 1871 Census was taken on the 2nd April.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Third Marriage and Family Life in Midlothian</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1878–1894</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In 1878, George Blacklaw, then aged 49 and working as a farm servant, entered into his third marriage with Marion Kerr, a 28-year-old farm servant from Newton, Midlothian. The ceremony took place at Wester Millerhill, Newton, within Edinburghshire (commonly known as Midlothian), a county that was undergoing significant social and economic change during the Victorian era. Despite the formal nature of the marriage, it was almost certainly bigamous, as George's first wife, Catharine Strachan, was still alive at the time.</p><p>By the 1881 census, George and Marion were living at Millerhill West, Newton, where George continued his work as an agricultural labourer. Their household included several children: Catherine, Alexander, Hannah, and John, with Catherine working as an outworker and the younger children attending school. The family was part of the rural working class in a region where farm servants and labourers were increasingly affected by declining agricultural employment and the rise of industrial work nearby.</p><p>During this period, George and Marion expanded their family with the birth of their daughter Georgina in 1882. However, the family also faced loss; their son John, born out of wedlock to Caroline Mathieson, died in 1884 at the age of nine from measles and pneumonia. The 1891 census records George, now 68, residing at Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, still employed as a farm servant. Marion, aged 41, worked as an outdoor labourer, and their household included sons William and Alexander, employed respectively as a furnace stoker and signalman, and their daughter Georgina, then a scholar.</p><p>Throughout these years, George's family life was intertwined with the broader shifts in Midlothian, where traditional mixed farming communities were adapting to industrial expansion, coal mining, and urban growth. His children began establishing their own families, with daughters Catherine and Hannah marrying local ploughmen and starting families of their own, reflecting the continuing rural roots amid a changing social landscape.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Final Years in Linlithgowshire</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1894–1899</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In the last years of his life, George Blacklaw resided in Linlithgowshire, a county in the Central Lowlands of Scotland known for its industrial and mining activity during the late Victorian era. This period was marked by rapid urbanisation and the expansion of railways, which shaped the working-class communities in the region.</p><p>In 1894, George experienced both joy and sorrow. His grandchild, George Blacklaw Whitelaw, was born on 15 March at Springfield Cottage, Carberry in the Parish of Inveresk and Musselburgh, Edinburghshire. However, just days later, George’s wife Marion (née Kerr) passed away on 28 March at Meadowfield, Duddingston, aged 44, from diabetes mellitus. The following year brought further grief when another grandchild, John Whitelaw, died at Springfield Cottage at the age of six from chronic gastric catarrh, likely complicated by malnutrition.</p><p>Despite these losses, life continued with new beginnings. In December 1896, George’s son Alexander Straiton Blacklaw married Mary Penman in Pathhead, Fife. Around this time, grandchildren Alexanderina and George Blacklaw were born in Musselburgh, reflecting the family’s ongoing presence in Midlothian.</p><p>George Blacklaw himself died on 12 February 1899 at Duntarvie, Abercorn, Linlithgowshire, aged 72. A ploughman by trade, he was widowed from Mary Kerr and succumbed to inflammation and softening of the brain after a week-long illness. His life spanned a transformative era in Scotland, witnessing the shift from rural agricultural work to the industrial landscapes that defined the late nineteenth century.<p>John Crawford, who reports George&#039;s death, is the husband of George&#039;s daughter Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw.  When the 1901 Census is taken Catherine and her husband John are living at West Pardovan Farm Cottages,  close to Duntarvie. So the assumption is George moved there to be with them.</p>

                <h2>Closing Reflections</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw's life as a ploughman unfolded against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Scotland during the Victorian era. While industrial growth and urbanisation transformed many parts of the country, George's work in agriculture reflects the enduring importance of rural labour throughout this period. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 would have marked a significant shift in family life and community rhythms, even in agricultural settings like those where George lived and worked.</p><p>Though details of his family life and movements remain scarce, George's story is emblematic of many who lived through Scotland's nineteenth century: balancing traditional rural occupations amidst the sweeping social and economic changes of the time. His lifetime spanned a pivotal era that shaped modern Scotland, linking the agricultural past to the industrial future.</p>
