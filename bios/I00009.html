        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw (1821–1899) was a ploughman whose life spanned much of the nineteenth century. Born in Kincardineshire, he moved across several counties throughout his working years before finally settling in Linlithgowshire. Records such as parish registers and census returns reveal a steady working life devoted to agriculture, reflecting the rural occupations common in his era.</p><p>George’s lifetime coincided with the Victorian era, a time of significant change in Scotland. This period saw rapid industrial growth, the expansion of railways, and increasing urbanisation. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 transformed family life, as children began attending parish and board schools rather than contributing to household labour. Meanwhile, coal mining boomed across central Scotland, drawing many rural workers into burgeoning pit villages, marking a shift in the country’s social and economic landscape.</p><p class="bio-author-notes">George has proven to be an enigmatic ancestor during research.  Born George Blacklaws, he abandoned his wife and seven children in Kincardineshire to flee to Edinburghshire with a younger partner with whom he had five children.  When he moved to Edinburghshire, he dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his name.  When his younger partner died, he married again, bigamously, and had another child.  The details of George&#039;s second marriage provide conclusive evidence that the Kincardineshire and Edinburghshire George Blacklaws are the same person.</p>

    <p class="bio-block-years">1821–1839</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>George Blacklaw was born on 8 June 1821 at Lambroos in Glenbervie, Kincardineshire, Scotland, the sixth child and sixth son of David Blacklaws, a subtenant, and his wife Elspet Edwards. His early years were spent in a rural setting typical of early nineteenth-century Scotland, where agricultural labour formed the backbone of family life. George was baptised shortly after his birth, on 24 June 1821, in the parish of Glenbervie.</p><p>During this period, George’s family grew with the birth of his sister Elizabeth on 6 March 1826 at Midtoun of Barras in the parish of Kinneff and Catterline. Elizabeth was baptised on 9 June 1826. Their father’s occupation is recorded as a labourer at this time, reflecting the modest means of the family and the rural working-class lifestyle they led.</p><p>George’s childhood unfolded during the Victorian era, a time of significant change across Scotland. While industrial growth and urbanisation were transforming many parts of the country, rural communities like those in Kincardineshire remained closely tied to the land. The introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 would later reshape the lives of children in Scotland, but during George’s youth, family and agricultural work were central to daily life.</p>

    <h3 class="bio-block-title">Life with Catherine Strachan and Family Growth</h3>
    <p class="bio-block-years">1839–1863</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In May 1839, George Blacklaw married Catharine Strachan in the parish of Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, Scotland, following proclamations on the 5th and 12th of May. At the time, George was a young bachelor residing in Arbuthnott, while Catharine came from Bervie. This union marked the beginning of a growing family during a period of significant change in Scotland, as the Victorian era brought industrial growth and social reforms.</p><p>Over the next sixteen years, George and Catharine had several children, with records showing births and baptisms primarily in the parishes of Benholm, Bervie, Edzell, and St Cyrus within Kincardineshire and Forfarshire. Their children included Edward (born circa 1840), George (born 1841), William (born circa 1843), Lilias (born 1845), James (circa 1848), David (circa 1850), Allan (circa 1851), and Elizabeth (born 1855). The family moved within the region, living in places such as Burnside, Bonhard, and Cottar House at Mains of Davos in Garvock. George worked as an agricultural labourer and later as a ploughman, reflecting the rural and farming lifestyle of the time.</p><p>The 1841 and 1851 censuses provide snapshots of the family’s life, showing George as the head of household engaged in farm work, with Catharine and their children living alongside him. Sadly, not all the children survived into adulthood; Lilias is believed to have died before 1851, and other family members, including George’s brothers, experienced deaths abroad or at a young age. Despite these challenges, the family remained rooted in the agricultural communities of Kincardineshire and Forfarshire during a time when compulsory schooling was beginning to change the lives of rural children.</p>

    <p class="bio-block-years">1863–1876</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>Following the death of his mother Elspet in 1863, George Blacklaw entered into a second partnership with Caroline Mathieson around 1864. This new chapter saw George and Caroline relocate from Kincardineshire to Edinburghshire, settling in the parish of Duddingston. The reasons behind this move and George's departure from his first family remain unknown. During this period, George began to use the surname Blacklaw, dropping the 's' from Blacklaws, as recorded on the birth registrations of his children with Caroline.</p><p>George and Caroline had several children together, all born out of wedlock and registered in Midlothian. Their first child, Catherine Jane Reid Blacklaw, was born in February 1865 at Old Southfield, followed by William in 1866, Alexander Straiton in 1868, Hannah Straiton in 1871, and John in 1874, all born in the Newton area. Caroline worked as a domestic servant throughout this time, while George continued his occupation as a ploughman and agricultural labourer.</p><p>By the time of the 1871 census, the family was living at West Millerhill, Newton, with George aged 46 and Caroline aged 30, along with their three young children. Despite the challenges of rural life during the Victorian era, including the introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872, the family maintained their agricultural livelihood in Midlothian. This period reflects George's continued commitment to his new family and the rural working life that defined much of his existence.</p>

    <p class="bio-block-years">1878–1894</p>
  </header>
  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In March 1878, at the age of 49, George Blacklaw entered into his third marriage with Marion Kerr at Wester Millerhill in Newton, Midlothian. George was recorded as a widowed farm servant, son of the late David Blacklaw and Elspith Blacklaw, while Marion, aged 28, was a farm servant and daughter of coalminer Andrew Kerr and the late Janet Kerr. This union was likely bigamous, as George's first wife, Catharine Strachan, was still alive at the time.</p><p>By the 1881 census, George and Marion were living at Millerhill West, Newton, with a household of six, including George's children from previous relationships: Catherine, Alexander, Hannah, and John. George continued his work as an agricultural labourer. The family expanded with the birth of Georgina Blacklaw in 1882, their daughter born at Wester Millerhill.</p><p>Tragedy touched the family with the death of young John Blacklaw, George's illegitimate son with Caroline Mathieson, who died aged nine in 1884 from measles and pneumonia. Despite such losses, the family remained close-knit. George's daughters Catherine and Hannah married in the late 1880s, establishing their own families, while George and Marion continued to reside in the Midlothian area. By 1891, they lived at Potters Row, Old Craighall, Musselburgh, with George still employed as a farm servant and Marion working as an outdoor labourer. Their household included their daughter Georgina and sons William and Alexander, both employed locally.</p><p>Throughout this period, George's life reflected the rural working-class experience in Victorian Scotland, marked by agricultural labour, family responsibilities, and the challenges of the era's social and economic changes.</p>

  <div class="bio-block-body">
<p>In the later years of his life, George Blacklaw experienced significant family events amidst the backdrop of his occupation as a ploughman in Wester Millerhill. In March 1894, his wife Marion Kerr, daughter of Andrew and Janet Kerr, passed away at Meadowfield at the age of 44 due to diabetes mellitus. Shortly before this loss, their grandchild George Blacklaw Whitelaw was born at Springfield Cottage, Carberry, Inveresk, to John and Hannah Whitelaw, née Blacklaw.</p><p>The family faced further sorrow when another grandchild, John Whitelaw, died in September 1895 at Springfield Cottage aged six years and five months, with chronic gastric catarrh and debility recorded as the cause of death. Despite these hardships, life continued with new beginnings; in December 1896, George's son Alexander Straiton Blacklaw married Mary Penman, a domestic servant from Pathhead, Fife. Around this time, grandchildren Alexanderina Davidson Blacklaw and George Blacklaw were born in Musselburgh, Midlothian, reflecting the family's ongoing presence in the region.</p><p>George Blacklaw himself died on 12 February 1899 at Duntarvie, Abercorn, aged 72. He was recorded as a widower of Mary Kerr and the son of David and Euphemia Blacklaw. The cause of death was inflammation and softening of the brain, with medical attendance noted in the final days. His passing marked the end of a life lived through a period of great change in Scotland, spanning the Victorian era's industrial growth and social transformation.</p>

                <h2></h2>
        <p>George Blacklaw's life as a ploughman in nineteenth-century Scotland reflects the enduring connection many had with the land during a time of significant social and economic change. Living through the Victorian era, he witnessed the transformation of Scotland through industrial growth and urbanisation, even as rural occupations like his remained vital to the country’s sustenance. Although details of his family life are scarce, the introduction of compulsory schooling in 1872 would have marked a notable shift in the daily rhythms of households like his, as children moved from contributing labour at home to attending school.</p><p>While coal mining and expanding railways drew many rural workers towards new opportunities in growing industrial centres, George Blacklaw’s role as a ploughman underscores the persistence of agricultural life amidst these sweeping changes. His story offers a glimpse into the experiences of those who maintained traditional ways of living during a century of rapid development and societal transformation in Scotland.</p>
