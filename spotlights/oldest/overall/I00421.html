    <p>Our oldest known ancestor, Marion Gray Whitelaw, was the first child and eldest daughter of William Maltman Whitelaw, a master grocer, and Mary Gray. One of 3 children, she was born on 29 May 1866 in the High Street, Haddington, Haddingtonshire, Scotland. </p><p>Marion Gray never married. </p><p>She died on 20 December 1966 at Birkenward Eventide Home, Skelmorlie, Ayrshire, Scotland, from generalised atherissclerosis with myocardial and cerebral degeneration, having lived for 100 years, 6 months and 21 days. </p><p>Marion Grey Whitelaw was a member of a prosperous grocer&#039;s family who traded on Haddington&#039;s High Street from the 1860s until at least 1911.  Marion was never recorded as having worked in the business, despite the fact that the rest of her family did.</p>

    <h2>Life and times</h2>
    <p>Born into Victorian Britain, Marion Gray Whitelaw lived through two world wars. In later life, she saw the creation of the National Health Service and the beginnings of the welfare state reshape expectations of health and security. </p><p>Much of Scotland’s nineteenth century unfolded during the Victorian era, a period of industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation. The First World War profoundly affected Scottish communities through enlistment, wartime industry, and local loss. The Second World War reshaped daily life across Scotland through mobilisation, civil defence and the demands of the wartime economy; In 1948 the National Health Service was established, offering healthcare free at the point of use to everyone in Britain.</p>
