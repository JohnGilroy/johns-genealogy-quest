                            <p>A report in the Yorkshire Telegraph &amp; Star dated 31 January 1919 described court proceedings at Sheffield Police Court involving William James Gilroy, a 27-year-old postman and former soldier. Gilroy appeared wearing his Discharged Service Badge and was charged with stealing money belonging to the Postmaster General after complaints were received about the disappearance of letters containing currency notes. Evidence presented showed that a test letter containing marked notes was posted and later found to be missing from Gilroy’s delivery, with the money subsequently discovered in his possession. Gilroy admitted taking the letter and pleaded guilty. His defence stated that he had suffered severe head injuries during the war, including the loss of his right eye, and had experienced mental distress since his discharge from service. The court sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment without hard labour.</p>                        </div>

                            The article is significant not only for the offence itself but also for the mitigation plea, which drew attention to the lasting psychological effects of wartime service. The defence described William James Gilroy as suffering from delusions and violent mood swings linked to severe head injuries received during active service, an argument that closely parallels modern understandings of post-traumatic stress and combat-related trauma. Seen in this light, the report provides an early example of how courts and the press grappled with the consequences of war on returning servicemen, making it particularly relevant for press media spotlights and reflective newsletter features.                        </div>

S. Skelton and Mr. T. G. Evans at the Sheffield Police Court, today, to answer the serious charge of stealing one £1 Treasury note, two 10 shilling Treasury notes, and 4 shillings 7 and a half pence in money, the property of the Postmaster General.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Geoffrey Chambers, who prosecuted on behalf of the postal authorities, said the prisoner was a reservist and was called for service in July 1914. In 1916 his right eye was destroyed by shrapnel, and he was finally discharged 1917. He was employed as a postman previous to the war, and after discharge he returned in the same capacity. At the time of his arrest his income including pension was £3 16 shillings per week.</p><p>During the past six months, said Mr. Chambers numerous complaints had been received by the Sheffield Post Office of the non-arrival of letters containing currency notes, and suspicion fell upon the defendant. Accordingly Mr. E. Stratford, the Secretary's Office, GPO London, came down to Sheffield for the purpose of investigation. On the 23rd January made up test letter containing a £1 Treasury note, two 10 shilling notes, and 4s shillings 7 and a half d in money, and all were marked in certain way. Next morning, the 24th inst., Mr. Stratford, accompanied by a detective, proceeded to Clubgarden Road, Sharrow, and posted the letter to a fictitious address at Dunford Bridge. Prisoner was seen to clear the letter-box, and on his arrival at the head office, his bag was searched but the letter was missing. On being questioned by Mr. Stratford he said, “I took the letter, and have destroyed the envelope.” The whole of the money and notes were found on him, and in addition two postal orders for 20 shillings&nbsp; and 10 shillings which he admitted stealing a few days previously.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Edward Stratford gave corroborative evidence, and Mr.J. R.Swinscoe who appeared for the defendant, said that while they pleaded guilty, there were certain circumstances in the case which the Bench might exercise in the prisoner's favour. For some time past Gilroy had been suffering from delusions, no doubt the result of gunshot wounds in the head. He had repeatedly told his wife that traps were being laid for him by the Post Office, and this seemed drive him into terrible tempers. When in one these attacks he did extraordinary things, said Mr. Swinscoe, knocking his head against walls, and becoming very violent. There was little doubt that these attacks were due to the injuries received on active service, and he asked the Bench to take a lenient view of the case.</p><p>&nbsp;The Chairman said Gilroy would have go to prison for three months, without hard labour.</p></div>                    </article>
