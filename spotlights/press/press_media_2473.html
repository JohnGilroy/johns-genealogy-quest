The ball bounced into Walker's ground, and when a boy named William James Gilroy attempted to retrieve it, it was alleged that the farmer warned him off. The boy's father took his son's part and the scene which followed resulted in Walker being summoned to Court for creating a disturbance.</p><p>A daughter of the accused, in the witness box, said that the boys' ball came into the garden and she saw Gilroy hammering at the dividing fence with axe or a hammer She informed her father, who went out and remonstrated with them. Shortly afterwards she heard the boy Gilroy's father shouting out in a loud voice. Witness went outside to see what was the matter, and to tell her father to come inside. She saw Wm. Gilroy, sen., lifting his hand and striking her father on the cheeks. Gilroy then pulled his coat off, took out his glass eye, put down his spectacles, and 'started on' her father.</p><p>Walker, in his own defence, stated that Gilroy came along after the incident with the ball, and stuck his face close to the witness and started shouting at him. He then took his left hand and struck witness on the left cheek.  Next he stepped back a pace and came forward again in a fighting attitude.</p><p>The Fiscal—Did you set your dog on the boy Gilroy?</p><p>The Accused —No.</p><p>Sheriff Robertson said he had no doubt but that a breach of the peace had been committed, and that both the accused and Gilroy were concerned in it. The whole thing seemed to have arisen through the children playing on the roadway. “I have no doubt that both the accused and myself, and everybody else who has been boy, and has played with a ball on the roadway, has knocked it into a neighbour's garden and got into trouble. People must keep their tempers and do the best they can under the circumstances. “Children will be children."</p><p>A fine of ten shillings was imposed and paid at the Bar.</p></div>                    </article>
