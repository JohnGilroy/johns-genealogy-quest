He ran up to drive the dogs away, but the larger one refused to go.  Witness said that he had an old sheep dog with him and the Alsation pitched into it and bit it in four places.  The Alsation then went for the witness and he drove it off with a prong.  The field was about a mile from where Mrs Gore resides.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Victor Barton, farmer of Coln Rogers, said he had had trouble previously through dogs attacking his sheep.  In the spring of 1932 some Alsatians got amongst a flock of sheep and lambs, killing one lamb and worrying another to death, and eventually he had some sheep that had dead lambs.  He had sent two or three friendly letters and told her she would have to pay for the damage to the sheep, and she paid him £10.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">PC Tilling said that when he saw Mrs Gore about the complaint he had received, she said that the dogs were not out by themselves on January 8, and that they were not the dogs that had worried Mr Barton's sheep before.  On two occasions he had cautioned Mrs Gore about her dogs.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Mrs Gore said that she had not received any complaints about the dogs she had kept since 1932.  They were kept in the house and slept in the house.  She had never seen any signs of danger with them.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Mr Gore, (husband of the previous witness) said one of the dogs belonged to him. He had had it about two years, and had never known it to attack sheep.  On January 8 they were under his control practically all day, and when he took them out in the morning it was in the opposite direction to where Mr Bartons sheep were.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">Frederick John Bartlett, gardener, who corroborated Mr and Mrs Gore's story, said the dogs were very quite, and would allow children to play with them,</span></p><div><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br></span></div></span></div>                    </article>
