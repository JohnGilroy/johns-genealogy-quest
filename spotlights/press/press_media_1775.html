                            <p>A report in the Cheltenham Chronicle and Gloucestershire Graphic dated 17 February 1934 described proceedings before the Cirencester Bench concerning allegations that two dogs had worried sheep near Fosse Bridge. Evidence was given by Albert Ernest Law, a shepherd employed by Victor Barton of Coln Rogers, who stated that he encountered two Alsatian dogs among a flock of sheep on 8 January and that one dog attacked both his sheepdog and himself. Further testimony referred to previous incidents involving sheep worrying in the area. Mrs Barbara Gore, of Mill House, Fosse Bridge, denied responsibility, stating that her dogs were kept under control and had not caused trouble since earlier complaints. After hearing the evidence, the Bench dismissed the summons on Mrs Gore’s undertaking that the dogs would be kept under proper control.</p>                        </div>
                    
                                            <div class="press-context">
                            The article highlights that the problem of dogs worrying sheep is far from a modern concern, having long posed a serious issue for rural communities dependent on livestock. The evidence reflects the practical realities faced by shepherds and farmers, for whom such incidents could result in significant loss. Read today, the report also hints at wider social change, as increasing residential settlement in the countryside brought urban attitudes and domestic pets into closer contact with working farmland, exacerbating long-standing tensions between agricultural livelihoods and non-rural land use. As such, the piece provides valuable context for understanding rural life and local justice in the early twentieth century.                        </div>

There were about 160 breeding sheep and the dogs had got them in a bunch. He ran up to drive the dogs away, but the larger one refused to go. Witness said that he had an old sheep dog with him and the Alsation pitched into it and bit it in four places. The Alsation then went for the witness and he drove it off with a prong. The field was about a mile from where Mrs Gore resides.</div><div><br></div><div>Victor Barton, farmer of Coln Rogers, said he had had trouble previously through dogs attacking his sheep.&nbsp; In the spring of 1932 some Alsatians got amongst a flock of sheep and lambs, killing one lamb and worrying another to death, and eventually he had some sheep that had dead lambs.&nbsp; He had sent two or three friendly letters and told her she would have to pay for the damage to the sheep, and she paid him £10.</div><div>PC Tilling said that when he saw Mrs Gore about the complaint he had received, she said that the dogs were not out by themselves on January 8, and that they were not the dogs that had worried Mr Barton's sheep before.&nbsp; On two occasions he had cautioned Mrs Gore about her dogs.</div><div><br></div><div>Mrs Gore said that she had not received any complaints about the dogs she had kept since 1932.&nbsp; They were kept in the house and slept in the house.&nbsp; She had never seen any signs of danger with them.</div><div>Mr Gore, (husband of the previous witness) said one of the dogs belonged to him. He had had it about two years, and had never known it to attack sheep.&nbsp; On January 8 they were under his control practically all day, and when he took them out in the morning it was in the opposite direction to where Mr Bartons sheep were.</div><div><br></div><div>Frederick John Bartlett, gardener, who corroborated Mr and Mrs Gore's story, said the dogs were very quite, and would allow children to play with them,</div></div>                    </article>
