    <h2>Life and times</h2>
    <p>During Fanny’s lifetime, much of Britain’s nineteenth century unfolded during the Victorian era, a period of industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation. The First World War profoundly affected British communities through enlistment, wartime industry, and local loss. The Second World War reshaped daily life across Britain through mobilisation, civil defence and the demands of the wartime economy. </p><p>Fanny lived in England, Fairford, and Gloucestershire. In England, she lived in the counties of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. In Gloucestershire, she lived in the county of Northleach, in Southrop. </p><p>Fanny worked as domestic servant (1881–1881).</p>
