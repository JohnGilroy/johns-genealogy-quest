    <h2>Life and times</h2>
    <p>During Marjorie Anne’s lifetime, much of Britain’s nineteenth century unfolded during the Victorian era, a period of industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation. Old age pensions were introduced in 1908, providing small weekly payments for elderly people with limited means. The First World War profoundly affected British communities through enlistment, wartime industry, and local loss. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918–1920 brought a deadly wave of influenza to British communities just as the First World War was ending. </p><p>Marjorie Anne lived in both England and Italy. In England, she lived in the counties of Berkshire, Hertfordshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, London, Norfolk, and Surrey. In Italy, she lived in the county of Gulf of Genoa, in Nervi.</p>
