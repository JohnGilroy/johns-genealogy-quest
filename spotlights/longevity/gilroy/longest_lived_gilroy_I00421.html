    <h2>In brief</h2>
    <p>The longest lived person from John&#039;s paternal line (Gilroy), Marion Gray Whitelaw, was the first child and eldest daughter of William Maltman Whitelaw, a master grocer, and Mary Gray. One of 3 children, she was born on 29 May 1866 in the High Street, Haddington, Haddingtonshire, Scotland. </p><p>She never married. </p><p>She died on 20 December 1966 at Birkenward Eventide Home, Skelmorlie, Ayrshire, Scotland, from generalised atherissclerosis with myocardial and cerebral degeneration, having lived for 100 years, 6 months, and 21 days. </p><p>Marion Grey Whitelaw was a member of a prosperous grocer&#039;s family who traded on Haddington&#039;s High Street from the 1860s until at least 1911.  Marion was never recorded as having worked in the business, despite the fact that the rest of her family did.</p>

    <h2>Life and times</h2>
    <p>During Marion Gray’s lifetime, much of Britain’s nineteenth century unfolded during the Victorian era, a period of industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation. The First World War profoundly affected British communities through enlistment, wartime industry, and local loss. The Second World War reshaped daily life across Britain through mobilisation, civil defence and the demands of the wartime economy. The National Health Service was established in 1948, offering healthcare free at the point of use to everyone in Britain. From the 1950s onward, television sets became increasingly common in British homes and began to shape shared national culture. </p><p>Marion Gray lived in Scotland, in the counties of Ayrshire, East Lothian, and Haddingtonshire.</p>
