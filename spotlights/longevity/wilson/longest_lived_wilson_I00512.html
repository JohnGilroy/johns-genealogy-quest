    <h2>In brief</h2>
    <p>The longest lived person from John&#039;s maternal line (Wilson), Henry Hinshelwood, was the fourth son of James Hinshelwood, a gardener, and Elizabeth Dickson. One of 3 children, he was born on 8 December 1831 in Simpson&#039;s Court, Potterrow, Edinburgh, Scotland. </p><p>He married twice (married Sybella McKerrow on 14 Sep 1862 in 10 Spring Gardens, Abbeyhill, Edinburgh, Scotland; married Annie George on 25 Dec 1874 in 30 Windsor Terrace, Milton, Glasgow, Scotland). Together, these unions produced 4 children. </p><p>He died on 24 June 1923 at Rockery Cottage, Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland, from myocarditis, having lived for 91 years, 6 months, and 16 days. </p><p>Henry&#039;s surname has also appeared in sources with the spellings Hinchelwood, Henchelwood or Henshelwood.</p>

    <h2>Life and times</h2>
    <p>During Henry’s lifetime, much of Britain’s nineteenth century unfolded during the Victorian era, a period of industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation. Old age pensions were introduced in 1908, providing small weekly payments for elderly people with limited means. The First World War profoundly affected British communities through enlistment, wartime industry, and local loss. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918–1920 brought a deadly wave of influenza to British communities just as the First World War was ending. </p><p>Henry lived in Scotland, in the counties of East Lothian, Edinburgh, Edinburghshire, Glasgow, Haddingtonshire, Lanarkshire, and Perthshire. </p><p>Henry worked as coachman (1851–1923). He was also employed as groom and caretaker.</p>
