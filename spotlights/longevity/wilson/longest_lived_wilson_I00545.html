    <h2>Life and times</h2>
    <p>During Jane Lamb&#039;s lifetime, Much of Britain’s nineteenth century unfolded during the Victorian era, a period of industrial growth, expanding railways, and rapid urbanisation. Coal mining expanded dramatically across central Scotland in the late nineteenth century, drawing rural workers into rapidly growing pit villages. The Second World War reshaped daily life across Britain through mobilisation, civil defence and the demands of the wartime economy. </p><p>Over her lifetime, she lived in 6 different places, including Yetholm and Crichton (1852–1943). </p><p>Jane worked as domestic servant (1878–1911). She was also employed as charwoman and school caretaker.</p>
