        <p>Hello everyone,</p>

        <p>
          Welcome to the first of what we hope will become an occasional family history newsletter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past few years we’ve been quietly researching our family tree — following certificates, census records,
          newspapers, photographs, and the stories passed down through the generations — and shaping them into something
          readable and shareable. This newsletter is a new way of sharing that work with family and friends who are curious
          about where we came from and the lives our forebears actually lived.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along the way we’ve discovered that our family story contains just about everything. Some lives unfolded quietly;
          others were shaped by scandal, hardship, poor decisions, or sheer bad luck. But threaded through it all are resilience,
          creativity, and moments of real achievement. Our aim is not gossip, but context — to understand people as they were,
          through the evidence they left behind.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          We’ve always been interested in where we came from and how ordinary lives intersect with wider events. What began
          as curiosity gradually turned into a long-running research project, pulling together records, newspaper reports,
          and family memories into a structured family history.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, we act as curators rather than storytellers for their own sake: following the records where they lead,
          and presenting what we find as clearly and respectfully as possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="nl-section" aria-labelledby="main-lines">
        <h2 id="main-lines">Our main family lines</h2>

        <p>
          To help you find your bearings, most of our research falls into four connected lines — two Scottish lines on John’s side,
          and two English/Welsh-border lines on Chris’s side.
        </p>

        <h3>Gilroy &amp; Wilson (John’s Scottish lines)</h3>

        <!-- Paired portraits -->
        <div class="nl-media nl-media--pair">
          <figure class="nl-figure">

            <figcaption class="nl-caption">John’s mum</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          John’s paternal and maternal Scottish lines largely begin with agricultural workers and domestic servants in
          Haddingtonshire, Kincardineshire and South Lanarkshire. Over time, many families moved into Scotland’s central belt
          as farming changed and industry mechanised — a familiar story of rural roots giving way to industrial towns and cities.
        </p>

        <h3>Reynolds (Chris’s paternal line)</h3>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          This line includes merchants, clergy and farmers from Yorkshire, Northumberland and Herefordshire, with many later based
          in London. It also contains our much-mentioned “royal connection” — traced through published pedigrees back to
          King Edward III — which is fascinating to explore, even as we treat it with a careful, evidence-first eye.
        </p>

        <h3>Law (Chris’s maternal line)</h3>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Rooted in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, this line includes generations of agricultural labourers. It also contains a
          dramatic chapter from the early nineteenth century, when family members were transported to Australia following protests
          connected to agricultural mechanisation — a stark reminder of how quickly social and economic change could upend
          ordinary lives.

        <p>
          If you’d like an early look at what we’ve been working on, the family-friendly website linked below shows our progress so far.
          Our research is very much a work in progress, so content changes as new records, corrections, and discoveries are added.
        </p>

        <p class="nl-linkline">
          👉 <a href="index.html">Visit the family history website</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The site includes readable biographies, themed spotlights, and visual summaries drawn directly from original records.

      <section class="nl-section" aria-labelledby="coming-next">
        <h2 id="coming-next">What’s coming next</h2>

        <p>
          Future newsletters will be shorter and more focused, often drawing on a single story or theme — a newspaper discovery,
          an unusual life, or a wider historical moment that shaped several generations. Some content will appear on the website
          first; some will be written especially for the newsletter.
        </p>

      <section class="nl-section" aria-labelledby="closing">
        <h2 id="closing">Finally…</h2>

        <p>
          If you have corrections, family stories, photographs, or memories you’d like to share, we’d genuinely love to hear from you.
          Family history works best when it’s collaborative.

          Thank you for reading — and welcome.
