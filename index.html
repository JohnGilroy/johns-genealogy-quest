          This site is a public companion to our private research database and WikiTree profiles.  Each biography is generated from John’s genealogical research and original records, then polished into a readable life story for family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our ancestry centres on four main branches:
        </p>
        <ul class="branch-list">
          <li>
            <span class="branch-label">Gilroy &amp; Wilson (John’s Scottish lines).</span>
            Agricultural workers and servants from Haddingtonshire and South Lanarkshire who moved into Scotland’s central belt as farming and industry mechanised.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="branch-label">Reynolds (Val’s paternal line).</span>
            Merchants, clergy and farmers from Yorkshire, Northumberland and Herefordshire, many later based in London, with lines traced back to King Edward III.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="branch-label">Laws (Val’s maternal line).</span>
            Agricultural labourers from Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, including family members transported to Australia after early 19th-century protests against agricultural mechanisation.
          </li>
        </ul>
