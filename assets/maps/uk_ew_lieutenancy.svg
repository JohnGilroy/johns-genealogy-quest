Spotlight Generator Skeleton 

A base class to be inherited by all spotlight generators

Methods:

construct - stub in case a spotlight ever needs it
run - entry point for the spotlight, input a params array.
buildModel - gather the data from TNG or elsewhere need to create the spotlight and structure it as appropriate. 
renderSiteHead - add the common site html head
renderSiteHeader - add the common site header - title bar and navigation
renderSiteFooter - add the common site footer - attribution and navigation
renderView - generates the html page
writeHtml - writes the page to the approprate folder
returnStatus - common return mechanism with a meta parameter specific to the spotlight
h - safe html
resolvePath - ensure correct or absolute paths use depending what and where writing

Decisions to be made:

The current spotlights_manager UI reads the spotlight_config and creates the params array passed into the run method.  Depending on the spotlight the catalogue entry for the spotlight will have at least one division and might have none or 1 or more pages.  I am wondering whether the UI should just pass the config catalogue identifer and the generator base class should have a method to validate and resolve the catalogue entry structure ready for the rest of the process?
