<p>In earlier centuries, large families were common and often necessary. High infant and childhood mortality meant that not all children would survive to adulthood, so having many children increased the chances that some would. Limited medical care, recurring epidemics, and poor nutrition all played a role in shaping family size.</p>
<p>For rural and agricultural communities, children were also an essential part of everyday life. From a young age they contributed to household labour — tending animals, working the fields, helping with harvests, or supporting domestic trades. A large family provided both economic resilience and practical support, especially where hired labour was costly or unavailable.</p>
<p>Children also played a vital role in caring for parents in later life, long before pensions or social welfare systems existed. In this context, having many children was not simply a matter of tradition or belief, but a practical response to the realities of rural living.</p>
